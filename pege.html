 <h2>Why is cybersecurity important?</h2>
 <P>In today's <mark>connected world,</mark> everyone benefits from advanced cybersecurity solutions. At an individual level, a <a href="cybersecurity attack.html">cybersecurity attack</a> can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.

Everyone also benefits from the work of cyberthreat researchers, like the team of 250 threat researchers at Talos, who investigate new and emerging threats and cyberattack strategies. They reveal new vulnerabilities, educate the public on the importance of cybersecurity, and strengthen open-source tools. Their work makes the internet safer for everyone.</P>
