        Sara sparked a popular movement of solidarity when she shot herself on a street in Taiz, southwestern Yemen.
        The incident occurred after Sarah went to a police station in Taiz governorate to report that her friend had colluded with a relative to hack her Facebook account in November 2022.
        Although the security authorities were able to identify the perpetrators, they remained silent and did not take any action against them, leading Sarah to attempt suicide in despair.

        Sarah's case is hardly the first of its kind. <mark><b>A number of Yemeni</b></mark> women who have been the victims of blackmail have either taken their own lives or been physically assaulted to death.
        For instance, 18-year-old Bushra was assaulted, kidnapped, and raped by a group of young men who photographed her and then threatened her with blackmail.

      <h2>Cybercrime in Yemen</h2>
      <p>
        Cybercrime is any act that violates the law using information and communication technology to target networks, systems, data, websites, or technology and facilitate the commission of a crime.
        Because such crimes violate the privacy of the victim by obtaining personal data and information without their knowledge, it endangers their lives and may even amount to committing murder.
